## Change Configuration

You can always execute the installation script with different options to
reconfigure Coolify.

For example:

- If you want to opt-out of tracking, execute the install script with
  `--do-not-track`.
- If you want to use the white-labeled version, execute the install script with
  `--white-labeled`.

:::warning 
Some configurations are not preserved if you would like to change them on an already configured instance.

These options are the following: `--white-labeled`, `--do-no-track`, `--white-labeled-icon`.

So if you installed Coolify with `--do-no-track` before, and you want to also use `--white-labeled` option, you need execute the install script with `--do-not-track` and `--white-labeled`! 
:::

## Restart
If for some reason, your instance crashes, you can restart it with the following command:

```bash
wget -q https://get.coollabs.io/coolify/install.sh \ 
-O install.sh; sudo bash ./install.sh -r
```

## Uninstall

You can easily uninstall Coolify by stopping the following containers,
`coolify`, `coolify-proxy` and `coolify-fluentbit`, or execute the following
script:

```bash
docker stop -t 0 coolify coolify-proxy coolify-fluentbit; docker rm coolify coolify-proxy coolify-fluentbit
```
