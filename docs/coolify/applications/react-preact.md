# React / Preact
Base docker image: [webdevops/nginx:alpine](https://hub.docker.com/r/webdevops/nginx)

What is the difference between these and the `static` build pack? The main difference is the predefined configurations. You do not need to set the proper install/build commands, publish directories, etc. Coolify will handle it for you.

You can customize this image with environment variables, see the [docs](https://dockerfile.readthedocs.io/en/latest/content/DockerImages/dockerfiles/nginx.html).
