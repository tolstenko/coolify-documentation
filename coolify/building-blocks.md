# Building Blocks - WIP

## Server

Servers are where all your resources are deployed to. It could be a local server (where Coolify is installed) or any remote server.

### Requirements

- SSH connectivity between Coolify and the server.
- SSH key for authentication.

### Actions taken by Coolify

Coolify will automate a few maintenance (system administrator) tasks on the operating system and monitors its resources.

You will get notified via the notification system you set(webhook, email, discord, slack, telegram).

## Project

Resources are grouped together into a project, a tree structure. A project could have infinite number of resources.

## Environment

Each project, by default have a `production` environment, that is not deletable, but renameable.
Environments consists of resources, like [application](#application), [database](#database) or a [service](#service), etc.

## Application

An application could be a web application, a static website, a backend API, etc. It is a container that runs a process deployed to a defined [server](#server).

## Database

A database is a container that runs a database process deployed to a defined [server](#server).

## Service

A service is a more complex type of resource, that consists of several other resources, like an [application](#application) and a [database](#database), etc.

Imagine you would like to deploy a Wordpress application, you would need a database, a web server and a PHP runtime. You could create a service that consists of these resources, grouped together and created automatically for you. Each resource in a service could be deployed to a different server.

## Proxy
A server could have a proxy that is used to route traffic to the right resource. It is not mandatory, but it is recommended to use a proxy.

## Destination
Destination defines the type of the containerization technology you would like to use. It could be Docker, Docker Swarm or Kubernetes.

## Source
Source defines the type of the source code repository you would like to use, like Github, Gitlab, Bitbucket, etc.
